RIPT Apparel Code Interview
===========================

At RIPT the print shop needs to run in the most efficient manner possible.  In order to turn around orders without a headache we need our orders sorted just right.  Orders need to be sorted through the following logic:

* Orders should be split out by shipping method.  
* Orders should be split out by orders that have a single item versus multiple items.
* Single orders should be ordered by size XS -> XXL.
* Multiple orders should be split in two groups (1) multiple orders that contain XXL sizes and (2) multiple orders that do not contain XXL sizes.
